## Airdots Double-Tap
### Will work with other earphones that activate personal assistant.
#### Adds the functionality to skip songs on double-tap with the "Xiaomi Airdots"
There are other apps with the same functionality (like MacroDroid) But they will keep running in the background.
I personally didn't liked this. Therefore AirdotsDoubleTap app will only run while skipping the song.
#
### You can install the app from the [play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orik.airdotsdoubletap)
### Or download the APK from the [release section](https://github.com/OriKerer/AirdotsDoubleTap/releases)
#
### How to use
* Install the app 
* Double tap the airdots 
* The device will ask you with which app to complete the action
* Select always with AirdotsDoubleTap

### Play Previous song
- Pause the media with one tap
- Once the media is paused, double tap
### Skip Media Backwards twice
* In most media players When the song is not at the start and the user skip backwards the song rewind to the start instead of skipping back to the previous song
* This options make the 'Play Previous song' functionality skip backwards twice in order to 'force' the media player to go to previous song
